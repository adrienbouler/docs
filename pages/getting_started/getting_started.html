<blockquote>
<p>PatchKit is currently in beta stage. If you're willing to get a free account, please be aware of the risks and write to <a href="mailto:contact@patchkit.net">contact@patchkit.net</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get started first please <a href="http://portal.patchkit.net">sign in</a> to your PatchKit account.</p>
<h2 id="create-the-application">Create the application</h2>
<p>First you have to create an application. In order to do so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Applications</strong> page.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Create New Application</strong> button.</li>
<li>Fill-in your application <strong>Name</strong> and select target <strong>Platform</strong>. Note that if your game have version for multiple platform, you have to create multiple <strong>Applications</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Create App</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your first application is now created!</p>
<h2 id="upload-your-game">Upload your game</h2>
<p>When your application is created, you will be redirected to application dashboard. Here you can change it's name, platform, get its secret and manage versions. To upload your game you have to create a new version.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>Create New Version</strong> button.</li>
<li>Set your version <strong>Label</strong>. Versions initially are identified by <em>id</em> number (1, 2, 3 etc.), so label is something more human-like.</li>
<li>Choose your game's <strong>content zip file</strong>. It should include all the files needed to launch the game.</li>
<li>Optionally specify the list of <strong>Changes</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Upload &amp; Create</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Be Cautious!</strong> When making a zip file, make sure that your game executable file will be located in the root of your zip file, not in a subdirectory!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you have to be patient. First your web browser will upload the zip file, so you will have to wait until it is done. When finished, you will be taken into <em>Version Processing</em> page. This page will display a real-time processing progress of your version. You can leave it open (it will reload to <em>Version Dashboard</em> when finished) or get back to it later.</p>
<h2 id="publishing-your-game">Publishing your game</h2>
<p>When your version has been successfully processed, you should be taken into <em>Version Dashboard</em>. Please read it carefully because it will let you know if there's something wrong with the content that you've uploaded.</p>
<p>In order to publish your version, click on the <em>Publish Now</em> button. You will be asked if you're 100% sure that you want to do that because that process cannot be reversed. When confirmed, your game is now published.</p>
<h2 id="downloading-your-game">Downloading your game</h2>
<p>Now it's time to try it out! On your <em>Application Dashboard</em> (if you're lost go to <em>Applications</em> page and then click on your application name) you fill find <strong>Launcher</strong> frame with the link to download it. Click on it and it will download a small launcher executable. Try to run it and you will discover that shortly after your game is now installed and can be played!</p>
<p>You can freely distribute this URL to anyone that you want to give your game to. It will always point to the newest version of your game.</p>
