                    <h1 id="what-is-patchkit">What is PatchKit?</h1>
<p>PatchKit is a <strong>Game Distribution Service</strong> (Content Distribution Service for games). It's a system that allows you to easily distribute your game to your players. You don't need any specific knowledge to get your game published, all you need to do is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an account</li>
<li>Upload the application</li>
<li>Click on the publish button</li>
</ul>
<p>And your game is now distributed to multiple servers all over the world!</p>
<h2 id="patching">Patching!</h2>
<p>One of the most important PatchKit features is application patching. When your player is willing to download your game, you can give him an URL generated by PatchKit. When he clicks it, an application called the <em>Patcher</em> will be downloaded to his computer.</p>
<p><em>Patcher</em> is a lightweight application that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download your game on the first run</li>
<li>Makes sure that player has the newest version before running the game</li>
<li>Makes sure that game files are not corrupted in any way</li>
</ul>
<p>This application does not need to be installed onto player's device. It just sits there as a part of your game. And this is really convenient for the player who does not like installing any additional applications in order to play the game.</p>
<h3 id="binary-diffs">Binary diffs</h3>
<p>PatchKit is using binary diff files to distribute game patches. Thanks to those upgrading to the newest version can be so fast, that your players may not even notice it!</p>
<p>How these files are created? When you're ready to publish a new version, just upload your game files to PatchKit and the system will take it from there. It will compare all the files and generate binary differences if needed. Those diff files will be distributed all over the world in the same manner as your game.</p>
<h3 id="customization">Customization</h3>
<p>PatchKit allows you to customize your patcher application however you want. You can also create your own patcher application! PatchKit helps you with that by providing API libraries and sharing its own patcher application on <a href="https://github.com/patchkit-net/patchkit-patcher-unity">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="supported-platforms">Supported platforms</h2>
<p>PatchKit is supporting these platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Mac</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>HTML5 (in plans)</li>
</ul>
